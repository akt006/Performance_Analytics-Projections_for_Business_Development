## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Performance Analysis

### 1. EDA and Outliers

- The dataset was initially cleaned, and a box plot was used to detect outliers. It was observed that these outliers could be beneficial in capturing future trends, so no steps were taken to cap these outliers.

### 2. Lead Generation Efficiency

- Arya exhibited the highest lead generation efficiency, making her performance a potential benchmark for other employees.

| Associate | Efficiency |
|-----------|------------|
| Raj       | 0.042230   |
| Arya      | 0.085114   |
| Ali       | 0.052842   |

### 3. Daily Performance Variability

- The standard deviation of daily leads generated indicates that Ali's performance is the most variable, while Arya’s performance is more stable.

### 4. Time Management Analysis

- A negative correlation was found between the average time spent per lead and the total number of leads generated. Arya demonstrated the strongest negative correlation.

### 6. Performance Consistency

- Arya had the lowest coefficient of variation (CV), indicating the most consistent performance among the associates.

### 7. High-Performance Days

- Analysis revealed that more time is spent on lead generation during high-performance days across all associates.

### 8. Impact of Longer Lead Generation Time

- Optimal time thresholds were identified for each associate, suggesting significant increases in leads generated beyond these times.

| Associate | Optimal Time Threshold (mins) |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Raj       | 307.86                        |
| Arya      | 126.62                        |
| Ali       | 259.62                        |

### 9. Comparative Day Analysis

- Raj and Ali performed better on weekends, while Arya showed slightly better performance on weekdays.

## Dashboarding

The following visualizations were created to provide a comprehensive overview of the associates' performance:

- **Performance Trend with Attendance**
- **Time vs. Leads Heatmap**
- **Monthly Performance Comparison**
- **Daily Incomplete Leads Trend**
- **Time Distribution Analysis**

## Recommendations

### 1. Performance Insights
- Arya’s higher efficiency should be leveraged by sharing her strategies with Ali and Raj.
- High-efficiency associates could be allocated more complex tasks.

### 2. Time Management
- Strategies should be implemented to help associates like Arya reduce the average time spent per lead.

### 3. Impact of Daily Team Reviews
- Encourage consistent attendance in team reviews to improve lead generation.

### 4. Performance Consistency
- Ali’s variability in performance should be addressed to stabilize his lead generation.

### 5. Breakpoint Analysis
- Incentives should be designed based on the optimal time thresholds identified for each associate to maximize lead generation.
